#### Future Updates
This web application is still in the process of being completed. In the future I hope to update the ordering system to allow users to select a date and time for their order as well as implement a delivery option for them I also plan on optimizing the cart system to allow users to delete specific items efrom their cart in addition to the option of clearing the entire cart.
